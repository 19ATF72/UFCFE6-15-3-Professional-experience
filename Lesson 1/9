Reflect upon a time when you needed to present or report to a group or individual, or when you had to discuss your work with others.  The audience might have been clients, customers, or other members of your organisation.   How did it go? Describe the positives and negatives of the situation, and describe what you learned, and how you might do things differently in the future.

After working on a client project for some hours, it was time to report on proggress to the client and my Client Manager to request more information.
It was my first time working with this client and I was inexperienced with their codebase.
I was basing my findings on the research I had conducted so far.
Instead of presenting half baked suppositions to the client, I instead opted to communicate my position to the CM to receiving a clearer project overview.
Due to this foresight it was possible to organise a catch-up session with the previous developper of the codebase.
During this meeting I shared technical information about the new problem that developed, and managed to understand what had caused it. Turns out the issue was related to a new larger piece of development that had been postponed due a change in scope.
Having gathered this information and having gained a better understanding of the systems workings I was able to
properly communicate with the client and offered a temporary fix as well as a structured long-term solution.
I managed to clearly convey the steps taken and present the required solution and steps they had to follow to proceed with the implementation. At this point the client signed off for the next milestone and we could proceed with the work.
Through clear and timely communication I improve efficiency and avoided wasting client time.
However I learnt to always communicate clearly from the start, especially if moving into unknown subjects.
