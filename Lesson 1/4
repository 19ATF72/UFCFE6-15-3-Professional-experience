Circle Interactive has a robust project kick-off workflow that delivers high quality and efficient solutions, even to non technical clients.
This is impressive since it allows customers to set out complicated workflows and detailed requirments in short periods of initial planning. It creates an initial scope of work and establishes functional, non functional requirments and system boundaries from the get go.
Circle Interactive achieves this through a rigorious consultation and requirments gathering stage, allowing for us to deliver exactly what the customer needs, within budget and time constraints.
The initial stage also includes the creation of user stories and establishes project milestones to ensure both parties are held accountable.

Something Circle Interactive is working to improve is the response to snagging issues and ongoing support tickets. As the methods to diagnose the issue quickly are limited.
The initial stage consists communication with the customer to gather information about the problem.
Since this proccess is not standardised, it is often nescesary to wait for a client response. This causes higher ticket times, and increases overall turn around time. While also reducing time available for development beyond diagnosis.
Attempting to remedy the situation Circle Interactive hired and trained 1st line support that provide client triaging.
However I believe more information such as screen recordings, and written workflows should be required as part of the initial submission proccess.
Circle Interactive should also aim to provide partly subsidised training sessions, where a member of the organisation receives traning on proper triaging procedures.
