During my time at Circle Interactive I employed the 'Reflective Practice' technique to record logs and reflect on my work.
I found this to be the best method since it provides clear steps and opportunities for short term review, with longer term improvement.
It employs a strategy similar to spiral software development, working in Plan -> Act -> Review -> Reflect incremental cycles.
I practiced this system by:
-Planning weekly academic work alongside scheduled work.
-Createing notes on procedures and documented tasks performed.
-Saving useful resources, articles, books relevant to my programme.
-Rrecordeding major workplace tasks in an online log weekly.

At the end of the week I held a weekly review and reflection session where I asked important questions about my work.
Understanding reasons behind why I undertook the activity, what knowledge and skills I gained.
Furthermore I noted the impact of the activity and the short and long term effects on my performance and learning.
This will all be very useful when it comes to interviews.
It will allow me to draw on my previous experience and to give a clear account of my skills.

Circle Interactive employs a similar strategy in the form of agile development.
This includes a weekly planning session, daily action with a morning review session in the form of standup and an end of week reflection.
Implementing a cyclic feedback structure allows for higher visibillity and will help stop blockages and potential conflicts early.
It also helps keep the team invested in their work.
