Has your organisation or team got a mission statement?   
If so, write it here.  If not, think about what it might be, and write it down.  
You may need to do some research for this question. (Sometimes these are "Vision Statements" or similar)

Circle Interactive mission statement is as follows:

Our vision is to enable our clients to use technology better in order to make a real difference.  We do this through high quality consultancy, development and support around open source software systems.

Our mission is to be a world class provider of that consultancy, development and support. To do this we:

    use high quality open-source software to connect people and data through     managed systems

    use our knowledge to support people through their own process of change and learning

    use our expertise and experience to empower people to get the most out of their systems and data

so they can make a real difference.

In order to deliver on our Mission, we have identified core values and behaviours that are important. These are:

    Building Trust

    Embracing Change

    Delivering Quality

In order to achieve those values we need to encourage certain behaviours.
