Some modules I found most useful were DSA (Data Schemas & Applications), which consisted of PHP, Javascript and databases development. These languages were all used during placement. The technologies studied directly corralated with my dailly work and were often supplemented by additional frameworks, such as the Drupal api.

Another useful module was OOSD since it covered the fundamentals of Object Oriented development which form the basis for Drupal modules and CiviCRM extensions. The practice of group development processes such as Agile and Waterfall were also vital, as they served as reference for the Kanban workflow used at Circle Interactive.

The final module that was useful was year 1 CANS (Computer And Network Systems), this covered the essential concepts of networking, use of the CLI and an introduction to version control software such as Git.
These are all present at my workplace and understanding them was invaluable. 
The least helpful modules were 1st year AI, and second year IS since neither platform makes use of machine learning algorithms or automation.

I would suggest more opportunities to practice collaborative software development during the course.
The opportunity to implement software development methods such as Agile in a group enviorment, and going through all stages from requirements gathering to sprints using product backlogs would prepare students for organisational work.
As the introduction of strict workflows and version control required being comfortable in collaborative development, being able to work in a team was nescesary.
Also a further analysis of test driven development would be preferred.
