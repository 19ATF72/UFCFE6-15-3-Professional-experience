The team is very good at partitioning work and working as a team.
There is great communication between the separate branches of the organisation.
The Client Managers interact well with the client and gather key requierments alongside the development lead, they then liase to partition it into tasks.
This allows them to efficiently assign them individual workers, and monitor developpers progress.
Thus improving understand of how time is being spent and if the project is still on schedule.
It also allows them to plan for unforseen blockages and react ahead of schedule to allocate more resources.

I would really like to emulate the CM approach to planning and client/developper communication.
This would be useful while working on my projects, both at work and at university during final year.
It would help me to better plan projects with schedule and clear milestones and allow enough time for improvements, setbacks and revision before a deadline.

A particular teamate I admire is Bails who posseses a vast knowledge of all subjects related.
He is very approachable and has a very contagious way of explaining things.
When you mention a topic he provides several contrasting points of view and well informed research of the subject.
I would like to gather enough knowledge and experience to be able to inspire others in a subject by being passionate in my explanations and showcasing how interesting it can be. I also would like to improve my knowledge of available technologies and techniques.
