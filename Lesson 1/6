The technical skills are those directly related to the technologies used.
This includes knowledge of proggramming languages such as PHP, JS, mySQL and use of Git and Bash.
It also involves knowledge of the development proccess in industry such as the Agile software development and the use of Kanban for project managment.
Furthermore it includes the use of design patterns, knowledge of sorting algorithms and data structures, and the use of external resources such as API's.

The fundamentals for these skills were developped at university and I was able to further practice in a working enviorment.
Most of the assignments done in class were verry similar to client work I faced during my time on placement.

The use of version control was somewhat covered by lecturers and implemented during my projects.
However during my time on placement I had the opportunity to work with a stricter workflow and with experienced teamates.
Git is widely used in software developments. Having to learn to implement it within a structure development cycle will be an invaluable skill in my future carear.
I was able to learn these skills by working with my team and contributing to the projects.

I also learnt the importance of interaction with non technical client managers who often did not posses all the knowledge about the software and were relying on me to communicate the implemented solutions in a non-technical way so they could check with the client and gather feedback.
