During placement year I planned my academic work alongside my employment.
I employed the 'Reflective Practice' technique.
-I recorded major workplace tasks in an online log weekly.
-I saved useful resources, articles, books relevant to my programme.
-I created notes on procedures and documented tasks performed.
At the end of the week I held a weekly reflection session on why the work was relevant to my course and what to improve.
Circle Interactive also provides a bi-weekly 'Learn Day' this allowed me as a student
to focus on my academic work while improve my knowledge on studied technologies.

This job is useful to my course.
It deepened my knowledge Web Development and Web Applications and increased my skill in programming.
This new found understanding of Web Development directly corralates with 3rd year Mobile Applications development as it uses similar technologies and frameworks.
It is also relevant to the Advanced Web Topics module, which includes many of the languages and technologies covered during my employment.

With the skills gathered from my placement, during my final year I will implement version control efficiently in development projects.
I will also apply a project manager attitude towards work, using milestones and sprints to finish ahead of schedule allowing for setbacks and revisions.
Finally I will approach my work with a better understanding of personal time managment, proggraming and a developed habit to working on projects for many hours a day.
I have also gained valuable insight related to my final year project.
