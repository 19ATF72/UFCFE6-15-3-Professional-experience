Research Curriculum Vitae

What is the point of them ?

- To get you an interview
- To get you past the first 5 seconds before HR bins it
- To shortlist you as a candidate

Who is the audience?

- The hiring manager, who is often not a tec. expert and who is simply looking for common sense metrics:
	- Such as technology keywords e.g PHP, MySql, Git
	- Good grades and a relevant university diploma
	- Other work experience to determine you are capable of holding a job
	- Good clear writting and well laid out info

- Most likely the development head or a senior developer, who will serve as a sanity check on the shortlisted candidates:
	- They will often check languages/technologies are relevant and correct e.g 15 years experience in Go (released 2009).
	- Check facts relating to your course, and modules.

What do they need to see on your CV?

- Clearly laid out facts without any fluff, they want your languages, modules and grades foremost, not your emotional language, horroscope symbol or volunteer work at the top.
- Your grades and other work experience should be prominently featured.
- Try to avoid cliches, since these will make it pretty obious you used an online template.
- Don't rely too heavily on soft skills, on a CV everyone is a hard worker and great at time management. Try and give examples on situations where these were tested and use figures.


For instance, if you have been involved in any staff recruitment (or discussions of) you might have a view on what is important from the employerâ€™s point of view.

I was involved in the initial recruitment drive and it is clear that this stage will not allow you direct communication with the HR team, it can however serve as a great time to get your foot in the door
specially if you have a great CV and attitude, I reccomend dressing nice and taking a CV and just engaging with whoever is at the stall, try and make it obious you want a job and try and ask them to pass the CV along to the hiring manager, this might get you a shortlist to the interview stage if you play it right.
