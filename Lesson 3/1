A code of conduct exists as a set of standards that define correct behaviours for qualified professionals in the industry.
It's objective is to protect public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of it's members and the enviorment. (British Computer Society Code of Conduct, 2011) An ethical code also acts as framework for socio-political and professional issues that result from computing technology.

They were introduced as a result of the mommentus expansion of computing into every industry this in turn was caused by the affordabillity and wide availabillity of computing technology and professionals. (Moor, J. H., 2001)

This created abounding cases of policy vaccums, a situation where it is unclear what actions remain within ethical bounds.
These conceptual muddles arise when behaviours aren't nescesarilly illegal, but could be considered immoral or unethical.
This is why an ethical CoC has to be developped, to offer context.

It introduces the concept that Computing proffesionals have a broader responsibillity than simply focusing on information processes, they also share the moral responsibility and should uphold individual and community rights. (Gotterbarn, D, 2010) This ethical responsibillity also extends to organisations, and to information they holds on customers.

Overall an Ethical CoC serves as a self regulating instrument for members of an organisation, it is a commitment to go beyond the legal requirements and to treat people equally. It outlines what behavior is seen as correct and desired.
