policy vacuums, conceptual muddles (where it is not clear what correct course of action is)

these ethical codes of conduct can be written or codified by large bodies and adopted by smaller organisation.
An ethical code of conduct is a set of standards that defines the correct behaviours for people working in the industry.
It covers a wide variety of actions including:

- Public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the enviorment.
- Discrimination based on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, martial status, nationality, etc.

INSERT EXAMPLES FROM BCS PAPER HERE.

These issues have legal, social political and professional rammifications that are brought forwward by the introduction of modern
computing instruments, information systems and their impact on society.
It has also arrisen in a greater way since incidents such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal and AI Learning.

Computer ethics involves analysis of the nature and social impact of computer technology.

CODE OF CONDUCT FOR BCS MEMBERS

Codes of Conduct are professional standards that will be applied to qualified professionals

LAUDON AND LAUDON
What is an ethical analysis?
it follows a 5 step process.

1.Identify and clearly describe the facts
Create and review the timeline of incidents to clear up errors in the initial reporting.
Ensure both parties contribute to the reconstruction of events

2.Define the conflict and identify higher order values
Define what ideals the parties are basing their descision on.
(freedom, privacy, protection of property, free enterprise).
Dilemas usually involve two diametrically opposed courses of action based on higher values.

3. Identify stakeholders
Who has desired outcomes in the issue, what can they gain from the outcome.

4. Identify the options you can reasonably take.
Sometimes it is nescesary to balance interests involved, therefore reaching a 'good' balance of consequences to
stakeholders.

5. Identify the potential consequences of your options.
Some options only work under certain scenarios, you have to re-evaluate your descisions at every stage.

YOU AINT SEEN NOTHING YET

The computing revolution is divided into 3 stages:
1. Introduction stage: access to computers is scarce, highly user unfriendly but some developing standards
2. Permeation stage: Aquisition due to need for buisness, status symbol, included capacitation of experts in other fields to bring them up to date.
3. POWER STAGE: people are no longer learning the tools, they have reached the coalface and can now develop in their field, the decision of who will control the power that comes from technology has arrived.

With technology the power diferential between the havs and the have nots is so great, that great ethical issues wil unfold.

The increase in proffesional competence will increase the need for policies and codes of conduct.

Abounding cases for ethical problems in the foreseable future are inevitable.
Machines are logically maleable, with new algorithms and interpretations computers can do what we want them to be.
There exists a policy vacuum.
Policy exists to ensure that actions remain within ethical bounds.
Introduces the idea of conceptual muddles, as areas where policy has yet to delevop as the use of computerised systems is unorthodox and unexpected.

/** USELESS
Makes an example with computer monitoring.
Should children be tracked for safety reasons, criminals, maybe top secret employees?

Makes anecdotal reference to avatars in online games and how this might cause harrasment.
And asks how actions in a virtual world relate to the real world. Do they carry the same weight.
Compares Moores law of doubling in computing power as a reference to an increase in ethics issues.

ADDRESSING HARMFUL PARADIGMS

Competent computing professional should be able to do more than just creating the most efficient/elegant algoritm or software.

An example is given about a group of CS students who have optimized an algorithm that will compute a firing solution that uses managment-by-exception (which seems very unlikely and agaisnt the geneva convention).
Therefore since it is too efficient 'the blame is on the CS Students'.

XP proggramers were a dick to people who cannot read small text.
Man this writter is a little bitch.
Kindle example on small button size for kindle.

Computing has a broader resposability than a focus on information processes.
It shares a moral resposability as well as a task responsibility.

It is important to create products that do not harm people
