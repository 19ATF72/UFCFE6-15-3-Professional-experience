A code of conduct exists as a set of standards that define correct behaviours for qualified professionals in the industry.
It's objective is to protect public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of it's members and the enviorment.
The ethical code provides a framework to legal, socio-political and professional issues that arise due to the
introduction of computing instruments.

The basis of ethical CoC is analysis of the nature and social impact of computer technology.
It was introduced as a result of the mommentus expansion of computing into every industry.
Due to the affordabillity and wide availabillity of computing technologies and professionals.

This created abounding cases of policy vaccums,
where it isn't clear what actions remain within ethical bounds.
These conceptual muddles arise when behaviours aren't nescesarilly illegal, but could be considered immoral.
These are areas where ethical CoC have yet to be developped.

It introduces the concept that Computing proffesionals have a broader responsibillity than simply focusing on information processes,
they also share the moral responsibility and should uphold individual and community rights
This ethical responsibillity also extends to the organisation, and to information it holds on it's customers.\

Overall an Ethical CoC serves as a self regulating instrument for members of an organisation, it is a commitment
to go beyond the legal requirements and to treat people equally.
