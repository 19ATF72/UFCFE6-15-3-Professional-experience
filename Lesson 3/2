Most of the guidelines covered in the BCS are clearly laid out and serve as good jumping off points for deeper discussion.
However the Section 3.e "NOT misrepresent or withhold information on the performance of products, systems or services, or take advantage of the lack of relevant knowledge or inexperience of others." (British Computer Society Code of Conduct, 2014) leaves an ethical dilema within itself.
It is not clear what does constitutes 'misinformation' or 'witholding' information and when it can be considered unethical.

For example, is it unethical to provide a user with a 20 pages Terms & Conditions document upon sign-up, where information relating to the users privacy and data gathering is at the bottom of page 19?
If so, many professionals are breaking the BCS and should be reported for misleading.

As it is already the case with EULA's and Cookie agreements, many companies introduce intrussive and deceptive terms and use data gathering techniques that users consent to simply out of ignorance.
Should this be considered unethical? The BCS offers little guidance, and deffers to the individual.
Who does the burden of discovery rest on? The client or the provider?

Could only highlighting a products features be considered unethical due to the omission of potential weakneses/vulnerabilities?
In this case the BCS CoC only serves as a framework, and can be somewhat vague, perhaps on purpose to allow for further ethical analysis and for members to decide based on individual circumstances.
