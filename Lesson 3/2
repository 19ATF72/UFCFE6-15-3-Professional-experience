Using the BCS code of conduct (available under resources and readings), 
discuss one point which you think is challenging, or difficult to understand or engage with.

Most of the guidelines covered in the BCS are clearly laid out and serve as good jumping off points for deeper
discussion.
However the Section 3.e leaves an ethical dilema within itself.
It is not abundantly clear what constitutes misinformation or witholding information and when it can be considered
unethical.
For example, is it unethical to provide a user with a 20 pages Terms & Conditions document once upon sign-up,
where information relating to the users privacy and data gathering is at the bottom of page 19 under section f?

It is already the case with EULA's and Tracking Cookie agreements that many companies introduce intrussive and deceptive
terms and data gathering techniques that many users consent to simpy out of ignorance.
Is this unethical? if so who decides? Does the responsibility of finding out fall to the consumer?

Furthermore is highlighting only a products strenghts and features considered unethical due
to the omission of potential weakneses/vulnerabilities?

The BCs CoC only serves as a framework, however it can be somewhat vague, perhaps on purpose to allow
for ethical analysis and for members to decide based on individual circumstances.
