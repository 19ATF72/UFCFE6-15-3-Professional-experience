1. If this works they can continue with a potentially lucrative deal while still maintaining the largest possible base of clients, at the cost of loosing key employees who highly value ethics and consumer rights. If employees are engaged and communicate this could cause mass resignations.

2. This could motivate employees to put aside their opinions and work for the insentives managment has provided. It is still possible some employees would not view themselves as guns for hire would protest leading to similar results to above.

3. Imposing soft restrictions to appease the development team is similar to providing economic insentives, it can placate their concerns and allow them to work with a clearer conciense as they have impacted change within the organisation, while still making it possible to work with the potential client as data is still being gathered at a smaller scale.

4. This option implements the developers suggestions about correct gathering and handling practices for customers data, it implements structures that protect consumer rights by changing data gathering to something like GDPR. Since at the time of this dilema this goes beyond the laws requirements it is possible some companies would opt-out of working with the organisation as it might hurt their profit opportunities.

5. While this option might lead to gaining public sympathy, it could also reduce opportunities of future buisness with many clients, as the organisation might be perceived as an activist group and could create levels of distrust about confidentiallity and buisness secrets.
