The stakeholders for this dilemas are:

- The developers: The developers have an interest in working at a company that represents their values and that does not require them to develop ethically dubious software or engage in what they consider immoral actions. Their desired outcome involves not working with any companies with anti-consumer practices, the term anti-consumer can be quite open and might include a vast array of companies. 

- The management team: Has a dual interest in retaining their capable developers by providing an enviorment conductive to performance. While also engaging with buisnisess and being profitable.
With an incentive to enter in agreements with clients that pay well and are within the confines of the law. They must appease the developers and also define a threshold of what is anti-consumer without ailienating too many buisnises.

- The potential client: Has an interest in developing a product which allows them to engage with their customer base and provide a service in exchange for their customers data, they would prefer that companies they work with hold similar values and prefer profitability over transparency.
They also would prefer the standard remains opt out instead of in, since many customers are apathetic.

- The end user: Is not directly involved but their interests are varied.
Some prefer transparency and privacy and might choose not to engage with companies that won't provide these. While others might seek out free services at the cost of transparency and their data, maybe out of ignorance or perhaps they don't care about data gathering mechanisms.
