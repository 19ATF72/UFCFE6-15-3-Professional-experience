Describe in your own words, a situation in which either you or a colleague has faced an ethical dilemma,
sometimes called a "policy vacuum".

During my time working at Circle Interactive, I questioned colleagues about ethical dilemas.
From this research I discovered some ethical dilemas faced by the company.

The issue arose when managment decided to engage in buisness with several companies that engaged in what the developpers believed were
anti-consumer practices.
These companies were involved


People at my org deciding to quit over the company dealing with organisations
abuse their customers with anti consumer practices.
