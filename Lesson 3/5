In this scenario the dilema arose due to a conflict in buisness practices.
Both organisations operated within the confines of the law and had at the time not explicitly broken any consumer protection laws.
One organisation favours it's stakeholders and the buisnesses ability to succeed and grow, while the other puts a higher emphasis on consumer protections. 

The higher values in favour of the consumer are:
- Fairness and transparency: Processing and the purpose of data gathering should be clearly defined and be limited to only data that is absolutely nescesary for the purpose stated.
- Privacy: Organisations should aquire legally defined consent from the consumer to capture their data and store it.
  They should also provide mechanisms for customers to opt out and remove any data held by them.
- Security: Customers information should be held in a way that protects it against theft from unintended 3rd parties.

On the other hand the higher values for the stakeholders are:
- Lawfulness: The freedom to decide how to operate as long as it is within the confines of the law.
- Freedom of association: To work with any company as they choose, and to cooperate with other organisations as they please.
- Freedom from regulation: To provide a service for free in exchange for understanding their customers and their habits, without the goverment interfeiring in how they do buisness.
- Freedom of choice: No one is forcing the customers to engage in the transaction with the organisation.
