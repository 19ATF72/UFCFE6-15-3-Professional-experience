An ethical dilema can be described as a conflict between issues that reference opposing higher-order values.
This conflict between these higher values such as freedom, privacy, protection of property, is often caused
by different priorities in the importance of higher values.
This leads to etical dilemas, where both courses of action support worthwile conflixting values.

The result of this conflict is a descision on what values are more important, and what metric will be used to decide a course of action.
Ethical dilemas often nesecesitate a clear understanding of ethical principles, that act as guiding principles for
many descisions.

In the resolution of ethical dilemas an ethical analysis can be carried out to
identify and decide which course of action and higher values are most appropriate and important.
This process involves describing current events, defining conflicts and identifying stakeholders and consequences.

Ethical dilemas in computing have a profound effect as they often deal with large amounts of important customer data,
and has implications that can affect the public safety and rights.
Descisions about product functionallity and implementation of certain features can
lead to ethical dilemas.

In tech specifically these dilemas often occur with features that would benefit the stakeholders
but would harm the consumer and invade their rights, such as large data gathering,
selling data to 3rd parties and goverments and obtrusive targeted ads.

In tech balance between shareholders and the public must be mediated by developpers
as they are more than guns for hire and should act as experts in the field.
