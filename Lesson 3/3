An ethical dilema can be described as a conflict between issues that reference opposing higher-order values.
This conflict between these higher values such as freedom, privacy, protection of property, is often caused
by different priorities in the importance of higher values.
This leads to etical dilemas, where both courses of action support worthwile conflixting values.

This requires descision on what values are more important, and what metric will be used to decide a course of action.
Ethical dilemas often nesecesitate a clear understanding of ethical principles, that act as guiding principles for
many descisions.
