An ethical dilema can be described as a conflict between issues that reference opposing higher-order values.
This conflict is due to different priorities in the importance of higher values such as freedom, privacy, protection of property (Laudon KC and Laudon JP, 2007).
In an etical dilema, both courses of action support worthwile principles and choosing a side often comes down to what values a person considers most important.

The nuance is in determining what metric will be used to decide a course of action and what importance certain values should have in society.
Ethical dilemas often nesecesitate a clear understanding of ethical principles, as they act as guiding principles for all descisions.
It is a process of describing the events, defining conflicts and identifying stakeholders and consequences.

I believe an ethical dilema is a conflict between the rights of an individual and the rights of society.
Especially in computing where descisions involve an individuals freedom and a communities right to privacy and safety.
For developers these dilemas are discussions about what features that benefit the stakeholders should be implemented, and what cost or benefit to the consumer is acceptable.
An ethical dilema is finding balance between shareholders and the public, and as Johnson (2008) says developers must be regarded as they are experts in the field.
