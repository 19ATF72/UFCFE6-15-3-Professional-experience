Identify the options that can reasonable be taken

Management has several options available with certain levels of risk.
Rainging from anti to pro consumer and with several gradients of severity.

1. They can choose to continue work with the client and emphasize that any actions taken are within the law, while reiterating that refusal to work is insoburdination and can lead to disciplinary action. As long as employees express their views outside of work they are ok to hold them.

2. Otherwise they can choose to engage with the development team and convince them of how the client operates in a legal way and is doing no wrong, while offering bonuses and performance based increases after the project to placate the team and encourage them to move forward.

3. They could also introduce soft restrictions on what data gathering they are willing to accept, in an effort to placate the development team while still maintaining a good relationship with the potential client and securing the contract.

4. After conducting an ethical analysis it is possible management agrees with the development team and places heavy pro-consumer restrictions on what data they are willing to proccess. This would involve the client agreeing or the work being terminated and refusal to work with thee company in any capacity. 

5. Management could also apply the somewhat nuclear option and expose the companies anti-consumer actions to the media, while gaining public sympathy this might also reduce their opportunity of future buisness with many clients.
