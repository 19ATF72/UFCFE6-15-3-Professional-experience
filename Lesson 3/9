Formulate an action Plan. This will need to be very succinct.

The action plan implements several of the solutions in an incremental strategy.
First management establishes an acceptable level of loss, this defines what can be used as leverage when bargaining.

After this, communicate with the client to gauge awareness of the current data gathering policies.
Management then establishes dialog with their employees to gauge their commitement to oppose the issue.

If resistance is light, then the first and second strategies are employed to convince employees to continue working.
However, if employees highly engaged, escalation to option 3 is tried and compromise from the client and employees is sought.

When these steps fail management must decide if they prioritise their employees or the potential client.
This will lead to either the fourth solution by implementing stronger data gathering policies and taking these requirements to the client.
Or an adoption of discipline/caution for employees who refuse to work.

If the potential client is highly inflexible and is commiting highly unethical/potentially illegal actions then
the option of refusing to engage with the client is a prefered, but the option of going public is also possible depending on severity.

After a compromise has been obtained and both parties have reached consensus with management the project can procceed as planned,
and management can perform an autopsy on the process to reflect and improve descision making and to update internal policies to ensure they are more inline
with company values to ensure this does not happen again.


High level workflow

1. Establish a threshold of acceptable loss of income

2. establish dialog with employees to gauge activism level

3. establish dialog with client to establish knowledge on the subject

4. attempt coerciosn

5. attempt bribery

6. offer scraps

7. offer iron fist

8. compromise
