I discussed the matter with the student manager at my organisation.
When the issue originally arose they were advancing from the role of developper into a more managerial position, this provides great insight into how management tackled the issue.

In his opinion, their reaction to the process and the steps I laid out were fairly similar.
He said my approach was somewhat more neutral to the way the problem was resolved.
He explained that in their case, management was much more attentive to concerns raised by the developers.
Since there is strong communication between management and the development team, they made it very clear that they would not work with the clients under current circumstances.
He mentions how they reached a consensus fairly quickly as management usually prioritises dev team concerns.
Since there is always a list of potential clients waiting for a spot, and the development team is comprised of experts in a somewhat niche system.
The student manager understands it would be a poor idea to remove qualified staff, that it might be difficult to replace.

From this reaction it is clear that his management style is oriented towards good relations with the developers.
It is also clear he places the public good above the clients interest, and therefore believes that the organisation should make ethical descisions to protect the consumer.
It shows he can strike a clear balance between what is good for the buisness even if it causes some negative financial consequences in the short term.
