Discuss this with a colleague or manager, and briefly describe their view on the matter. What is their reaction, and what does this tell you about their management style?

They agree, since i wrote it
I discussed the matter with the student manager at my organisation.
They were at the time in the proccess of advanced from the role of developper into a more manager oriented position, 
and therefore had great insight into how management tackled the issue when it arose.

Their reaction to the process laid out was that it was a fairly accurate if somewhat more neutral approach to the way the problem was resolved.
